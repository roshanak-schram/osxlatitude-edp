><P
>&#13;				SSL/TLS is a communication protocol which encrypts data exchanged between the server and the client. It is used to transfer HTTP requests and responses securely on the network in order to prevent spying or data sniffing.

				

			</P
><P
>&#13;				To secure one of your hosts or the console with SSL, you first need to generate a private key. A private key should never be disclosed as it is used to cipher (i.e. encode) transferred data.

			</P
><P
>&#13;				SSL/TLS requires also that the server makes its real identity available to the client by sending a certificate as soon as a connection is established between both of them. A certificate contains information about the certificate holder. If you intend to host a business site or a site where sensitive data is expected to be gathered or displayed, we strongly recommend that the certificate is signed by an independent certification authority which will check the holder information. A certificate that is not signed by a certification authority will work but the visitors' browsers will always display a warning message and invite them to confirm that they trust your self-signed certificate.

			</P
><P
>&#13;				To sign a certificate by a certification authority, you have to create a CSR (Certificate Signing Request). A CSR is generated by choosing a private key and by entering your information. Once the CSR generated, you will have to send it to a certification authority which will do the necessary to check your information and to generate a signed certificate. Note that only the CSR has to be sent to the certification authority, the private key used to generate it should never be sent to them. When you receive the signed certificate, all you have to do is to enter it in Abyss Web Server console to start using it.

>About the "Server Type" question: </B

					Some certification authorities will ask you about your server type. This information is mainly used for statistical purposes and makes no difference on the final signed certificate they will deliver. If you do not find Abyss Web Server on their list, select <B
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Other Web Server</B
> or <B
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Other</B
>. If no such choices are available, you can select <B
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>OpenSSL</B
> or <B
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>OpenSSL-based server</B
>. Again if no such choices are available, you can safely select <B
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Apache</B
> or <B
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>ModSSL</B
> as our SSL/TLS implementation is based on OpenSSL which is also used by Apache and ModSSL.

>Self-signed certificates security: </B
>
				 	A site using a self-signed certificate offers the same security as a site using a certificate signed by a certification authority since the encryption is private key dependent only. But consider that self-signed certificates cannot be trusted by visitors who do not know you. So use them only for tests or for sites which access is limited and which visitors trust you (for example in an Intranet or for a family Web site).
